Of course. A "Quick Links" section is a great way to improve user experience on the dashboard. I will create a professional-looking component using Tailwind CSS with icons and clean styling.
Here's the plan:
I'll design a new QuickLinks component directly within your dashboard page file (src/app/[farmId]/dashboard/page.tsx).
This component will feature a responsive grid with four distinct, clickable cards for "Add Livestock", "Record Eggs", "Add Expense", and "Record Sale".
Each card will have a relevant SVG icon, a clear label, and a subtle hover effect for better interactivity.
I will then integrate this new component into your main dashboard layout.
First, I need to read the current dashboard page to find the best place to add the new section.
Thank you for providing the dashboard file. I see you already have a "Quick Links" section, which is great! However, I can definitely enhance it to be more visually appealing and user-friendly, as you requested.
I will replace the existing, simple link-based component with a more professional, icon-driven design. This new component will be defined directly in the dashboard file for simplicity.
Here is the plan:
Define a new QuickLinkCard component with a modern, icon-based design using Tailwind CSS.
Create an array of quickLinks data to easily manage the links, icons, and labels.
Replace the old "Quick Links" section with a new, responsive grid that uses the QuickLinkCard component.
This will give your dashboard a much cleaner and more professional feel. I will now apply these changes to your src/app/[farmId]/dashboard/page.tsx file

Excellent! This is a fantastic next step to make the dashboard truly functional. I'll create a professional and intuitive user interface for each of the four "Quick Actions" pages, keeping in mind the specific needs of a poultry farm.
Here is my plan:
Add Livestock: A detailed form to register new birds, capturing essential data like type, breed, quantity, and cost.
Record Eggs: A quick and easy form for daily egg collection logging, including quantities and notes.
Add Expense: A categorized form for tracking farm expenditures, from feed to utilities.
Record Sale: A simple form to log income from sales of eggs, birds, or other farm products.
I will create all four pages for you now, each with a clean, user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS.

Excellent idea. A well-designed settings page is crucial for user engagement. I will create a professional and comprehensive "Profile Settings" UI for you, using dummy data for now as requested.
Here's the plan:
Structure the Page: I'll design a clean, multi-section form that separates "Personal Information" from "Farm Details."
Personal Information: This section will include fields for the user's name, email (read-only), and an option to change their password.
Farm Details: This section will allow editing of the farm's name, location, and a short description.
Professional Styling: The entire page will be styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience, complete with a profile picture upload component.
I will now create the new src/app/[farmId]/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx file with this professional UI
